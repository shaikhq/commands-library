# Resolving ChromaDB's SQLite3 Version Compatibility in Python Environments

In the process of developing a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline, I integrated ChromaDB as my in-memory vector storage solution. ChromaDB is an open-source vector database designed for storage and retrieval of vector embeddings. Internally, ChromaDB uses SQLite3, a lightweight, serverless relational database engine, to manage its data storage. SQLite3 is embedded directly into applications, providing a self-contained, zero-configuration database engine that stores data in a single file on disk.

**Encountering the Issue**

During implementation, I encountered an error when initializing ChromaDB within my Jupyter Notebook:


```
RuntimeError: Your system has an unsupported version of sqlite3. Chroma requires sqlite3 >= 3.35.0.
```


This error indicated that ChromaDB requires SQLite3 version 3.35.0 or higher, but my system's default SQLite3 version was outdated.

**Initial Attempts to Resolve**

1. **Upgrading System SQLite3**: I first attempted to update the SQLite3 version on my Linux virtual machine. Despite successfully upgrading the system-wide SQLite3, the Python environment within Jupyter Notebook continued to reference the older version, as Python's standard library includes its own SQLite3 module compiled during Python's installation.

2. **Recompiling Python**: I considered recompiling Python after upgrading SQLite3 to ensure that Python's built-in `sqlite3` module linked against the updated SQLite3 library. However, this process is time-consuming and may not be feasible in all environments.

**Effective Solution: Utilizing `pysqlite3-binary`**

To resolve the version mismatch without recompiling Python, I discovered the `pysqlite3-binary` package. This package provides a precompiled, a recent version of SQLite3 that can override the default module.

**Implementation Steps**

1. **Install `pysqlite3-binary`**: I installed the package in my Python environment, `venv`, using:

   ```bash
   pip install pysqlite3-binary
   ```


2. **Override the Default `sqlite3` Module**: Before importing ChromaDB or any module that relies on SQLite3, I added the following code to my script or notebook:

   ```python
   __import__('pysqlite3')
   import sys
   sys.modules['sqlite3'] = sys.modules.pop('pysqlite3')
   ```


   This code replaces the standard `sqlite3` module with the one provided by `pysqlite3-binary`, ensuring compatibility with ChromaDB.

**Considerations**

- **Environment Specificity**: It's essential to ensure that `pysqlite3-binary` is installed in the specific Python environment or virtual environment used by your Jupyter Notebook or application.

- **Order of Imports**: The override must occur before importing any modules that depend on SQLite3 to prevent the older version from being loaded into memory.

- **Platform Compatibility**: The `pysqlite3-binary` package is compatible with many Unix-like systems. For Windows users, alternative solutions may be necessary, as the package may not be available or compatible.

By implementing this solution, I successfully aligned the SQLite3 version with ChromaDB's requirements, enabling seamless functionality within my RAG pipeline.
